 # create /etc/smartap.conf with default device configuration
 # create /etc/wpa.conf

Define a service port on one of the spare ethernet interfaces, so that if the network config is hosed, we can still access the box on this service port.  For Soekris net4511 and net4521, the service port is sis1.  Set the IP of this to 192.168.168.168 (or anything you prefer, and not used for other network interfaces on the device).

Add to `/etc/rc.conf`
{{{
# -- Service Port
ifconfig_sis1="inet 192.168.168.168 netmask 255.255.255.0"
}}}

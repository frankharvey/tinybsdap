#summary Adding Ports to a fresh TinyBSD Build

= Introduction =

The basic TinyBSD build is quite bare-boned, containing a minimalistic 802.11 capable system.  TinyBSD_AP incorporates some additional tools, some of them nice-to-haves and some of them necessary features.  This page documents process of building such features.

=== bash ===

{{{
cd /usr/ports/shells/bash
make clean
make install PREFIX=/mnt/ FORCE_PKG_REGISTER=yes
}}}

This will install the 'bash' port on the image as seen below
{{{
[root@fbsd70 /mnt]# find . -name bash
./bin/bash
./share/doc/bash
./share/bash

}}}

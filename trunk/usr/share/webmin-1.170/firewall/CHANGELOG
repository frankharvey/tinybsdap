---- Changes since 1.160 ----
Added button for re-setting the firewall to a default configuration.
Added module configuration options for commands to run before and after the firewall is applied.
The firewall configuration can now be copied automatically to multiple hosts in a cluster, and will be applied on all hosts when the the Apply button is clicked. Like other cluster features in Webmin, this requires that the servers be first setup in the Webmin Servers Index module.
